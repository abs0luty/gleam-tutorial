## Who this tutorial is made for

This tutorial is for people who’ve written code before and don’t need hand-holding on the absolute basics. If you already know what variables, functions, types, and control flow are, you’re in the right place. 

We'll go fast on "intro to programming" stuff and focus on how BEAM and Gleam do things.

You **don't** need prior functional-programming experience. If you’ve mostly lived in Python/JS/Go/C++ and you're curious about a friendly functional language on the BEAM, you'll be fine. Plenty of respected language guides set similar expectations - for example, *Learn You a Haskell* explicitly targets people who've programmed before but are new to FP, which is the same vibe we're going for. ([learnyouahaskell.com][1])

Think of this as a practical, programmer-to-programmer tour. Like the Go Tour and the Rust Book, we'll move quickly from syntax to real patterns and habits, assuming you can already read code and run tools; the goal is to level up how you build, not teach what a loop is. ([Go.dev][2])
